# zen-habit-tracker

A React Native app for habit tracking. This app will allow users to create, track, and manage their daily habits. The app should feature a simple, user-friendly interface for adding new habits, marking them as complete, and viewing progress over time. The design should be minimalistic, with a focus on functionality and ease of use. Ideal features include customizable habit tracking, reminders, and progress visualization through charts or graphs.
